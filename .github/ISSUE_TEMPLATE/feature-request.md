**What are you trying to do, and to what extent does PrtgAPI provide existing functionality around this?**

- [ ] I've read the [wiki](https://github.com/lordmilko/PrtgAPI/wiki) and am sure this feature doesn't already exist
- [ ] This is a general feature that belongs in PrtgAPI and isn't highly specific to my scenario
